    <h1>AVENGERS</h1>
    <h2>The Avengers are a team of superheroes in Marvel Comics, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963. They are Earth's mightiest heroes, assembled to protect the world from powerful threats. The original team included Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Ant-Man, and Wasp, with Captain America joining later. Over time, the team expanded to include heroes like Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man.

        In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the Avengers debuted in The Avengers (2012), led by Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. They battled threats like Loki, Ultron, and Thanos, with Avengers: Endgame (2019) being their biggest battle, where they defeated Thanos.

        The Avengers symbolize teamwork, sacrifice, and heroism, making them one of the most iconic superhero teams in history. Their motto is: "Avengers, Assemble!" ðŸš€ðŸ”¥</h2>
